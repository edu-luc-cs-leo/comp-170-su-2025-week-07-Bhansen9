After comparing week06 solutions and my own answers I think this was the best I have performed. As all functions were able to do their job correctly on top of that,
 the testing that I made worked and would give the functions empty data to see how the function would respond. All answers I gave had very similar logic and all used the same 
 function operators that the solutions used to manipulate the data and the lists that would be returned. Some of the operators Iâ€™m talking about is the .append function to add 
 certain words or characters to a list that had the right data I was looking for. This was used in problems 1 and 3 for me, however problem 3 on the solutions did not use it as
   it used c to add char by char. I think this was really one of my only mistakes I could have made. Although my function using .append does still have the same output and
     works on other test lists. I especially made sure to add comments in week06 and I think this really helps and shows my thought process. Going forward I need to start
       incorporating these more into my code for both people reading it and also for preparation of high level coding.
